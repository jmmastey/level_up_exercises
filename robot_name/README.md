## Short Methods

Thanks to exercism for the code inspiration. The adjoining code is a Robot Naming class. Its job is to create new names for each robot that gets instantiated, without allowing duplicates. The code probably works (no tests?), but it suffers from some stylistic problems. Fix it!

While you're at it, refactoring should allow you to make the class more robust in case of name collisions. Go ahead and do that too.
