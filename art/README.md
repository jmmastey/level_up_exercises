# The Center for Performance Art

Thanks to your STEM background and a poor decision to "volunteer" at a recent board meeting, you've been placed in charge of the technology platform for the local Center for Performance Art. The last person in charge of the platform may have been someone's "tech-savvy" neice or somesuch, and while she did get a site out to production, it's been creaking ever since. Also, what's with that layout? Did nobody ever invent Twitter Bootstrap?

Anyway, now that this mess is your mess, your first job (even before adding the bootstrap-rails gem) is to work on some of the performance issues the site's been having. When the Center only had a few visitors and only tracked a few theatre companies everything was hunky-dory, but now that things are growing, the performance of the app has become a problem. Time to roll up your sleeves and get to work.

### The Assignment

This codebase is specially prepared to be monstrously slow. Congratulations! Take a look at http://leveluprails.com/scaling.html for the suggested learning and fixes.
