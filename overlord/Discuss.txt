1. How should my steps be organized?
	- Some steps overlap, so it's harder to group...

2. Is there a better way to handle repition acoss feature steps?
	- Make them 'inherit' from eachother?

3. What's the correct level of controller cleaning?
	- It's all setting and unsetting session vars rather than lots of 
	logic, so it feel wierd putting such specific "var setting"s
	into methods. 
	- Also, it feels done arbitrary based purely on number of lines...

4. Check why the methods are necessary in Bomb init.

5. So much of cucumber (and by extension Capybara) seems reliant
   on seemingly brittle tests such as specific DOM content and text.



6. (No Point Yet) It feels like all the testing is so crazy.
	-So involved...
		* Gems, testing frameworks
		* Types of tests
		* Styles (BDD, EDD, TDD, User_stores)
		* Tools for testing (Stubs, mocks, factories, fixtures)
