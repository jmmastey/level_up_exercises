So, I lied above obviously. Sometimes comments are actually necessary. Name (and defend) some cases where you should add comments to your code.

  Documentation isn't really commenting but if it were that would be a good place to write them down eg(.md, .rdoc etc)
  When writing a very complex code that you simply can't simplify to a baby's level.
  When writing code for an API that can only be blackbox tested.
  When writing tests that require external data testing (when testing for accuracy or what not, e.g doing Math in a higher level).
  When trying to explain edge cases or some pecularities on your code or tests.
