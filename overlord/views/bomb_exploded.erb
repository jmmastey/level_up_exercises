<h3> Dear Heroic Individual, </h3>
<h3 class="box"> Although the bomb went off, you can take comfort in 
knowing that it was in the middle of the desert and no 
one was around.  Luckily, I am not one of those malevolent overlords. 
 I applaud your efforts but nonetheless recommend
you work on your bomb deactivation skills.  </h3>

<h3> With kindest personal regards, </h3>
<h3 class="salutation" align="center"> Overlord </h3>
