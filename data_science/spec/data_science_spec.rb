For a given experiment, we're looking to calculate the conversion rate of
visitors as part of a split test. We care about the following factors:

1. Total sample size 
  
2. Number of conversions for each part of the test.

3. Percentage of conversion (including error bars) with a 95% confidence.

4. Confidence level that the current leader is in fact better than random. You
should use the Chi-square test for this, feel free to cheat with a simple
calculator to get your initial calculations.
