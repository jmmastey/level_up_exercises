## Choose Your Destiny

We're going to spend some time on this one, so it's time to Choose Your Own Adventureâ„¢. You'll be writing one of these Rails applications and refactoring it for a while, so pick something interesting.

The goal here is to consume and transform an API that is provided elsewhere. Integration of third party functionality core to a lot of what we do, so you need the practice.

* If you're new in town, think about building the [Local Events Aggregator](../happenings/).
* If you like a challenge, advance to the [Congressional Good Deeds Feed](../opposite_of_progress/).
* If none of these things apply to you, but you have experienced weather events in the past, turn to page 46 and take a big whiff of the [Forecast Reminder](../event_system/).
* Alternatively, if none of these strike your fancy, find an API to consume, transform and republish and work with me to make sure it fits the bill. As a few ideas:

Good luck!
