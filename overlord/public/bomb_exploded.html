<h3> Dear Heroic Individual, </h3>
<h3 class="box"> Although the bomb went off, you can take comfort in 
knowing that it was in the middle of the desert and no 
one was around. Not even a bunny! I applaud your efforts but nonetheless recommend
you work on your bomb deactivation skills.  You never
know when you might encounter one of those malevolent overlords. . . </h3>

<h3> With kindest personal regards, </h3>
<h3 align="middle"> Overlord </h3>
