# Shopping Cart Test Plan

There are 3 primary stages: Shopping (browsing the store), Checkout (Pre-confirmation, editing order details), Confirmation (Post-checkout). These three phases will help to organize an effective test plan.

## Browsing

Browsing is the act of continue to shop around without directly managing the shopping cart's details. While browsing, the user should see a cart widget somewhere. Tests may include the ability to add new items (with different quantities) and have the cart widget update accordingly (if the user opts to continue shopping after adding a new item).

## Checkout (Pre-confirm)

Manage Items: Remove, Change Quantity, Save item for later.
Payment: Coupons, Reward(other), Billing (Type/Info/Address/etc)
Shipping (Address)
- This is an important case as the shipping address may impact the billing or other order details.
