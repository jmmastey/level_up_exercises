# The `.rspec` file also contains a few flags that are not defaults but that
# users commonly want.
#
# See http://rubydoc.info/gems/rspec-core/RSpec/Core/Configuration
RSpec.configure do |config|
  # rspec-expectations config goes here. You can use an alternate
  # assertion/expectation library such as wrong or the stdlib/minitest
  # assertions if you prefer.
  config.expect_with :rspec do |expectations|
    # This option will default to `true` in RSpec 4. It makes the `description`
    # and `failure_message` of custom matchers include text for helper methods
    # defined using `chain`, e.g.:
    # be_bigger_than(2).and_smaller_than(4).description
    #   # => "be bigger than 2 and smaller than 4"
    # ...rather than:
    #   # => "be bigger than 2"
    expectations.include_chain_clauses_in_custom_matcher_descriptions = true
  end

  # rspec-mocks config goes here. You can use an alternate test double
  # library (such as bogus or mocha) by changing the `mock_with` option here.
  config.mock_with :rspec do |mocks|
    # Prevents you from mocking or stubbing a method that does not exist on
    # a real object. This is generally recommended, and will default to
    # `true` in RSpec 4.
    mocks.verify_partial_doubles = true
  end

  # The settings below are suggested to provide a good initial experience
  # with RSpec, but feel free to customize to your heart's content.
  #   # These two settings work together to allow you to limit a spec run
  #   # to individual examples or groups you care about by tagging them with
  #   # `:focus` metadata. When nothing is tagged with `:focus`, all examples
  #   # get run.
  #   config.filter_run :focus
  #   config.run_all_when_everything_filtered = true
  #

  #   # Many RSpec users commonly either run the entire suite or an individual
  #   # file, and it's useful to allow more verbose output when running an
  #   # individual spec file.
  #   if config.files_to_run.one?
  #     # Use the documentation formatter for detailed output,
  #     # unless a formatter has already been configured
  #     # (e.g. via a command-line flag).
  #     config.default_formatter = 'doc'
  #   end
  #
  #   # Print the 10 slowest examples and example groups at the
  #   # end of the spec run, to help surface which specs are running
  #   # particularly slow.
  #   config.profile_examples = 10
