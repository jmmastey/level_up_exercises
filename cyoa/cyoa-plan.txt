Going to make the rails app on a branch of the level_up_exercises project, rooted in the cyoa folder

High level business requirements:

  Grab each bill that congress passes.
  Store bill data in a local db.
  Pull new bill data on a schedule.
  Display last N bills on the homepage.
  Allow users to log in with facebook and github.
  Allow users to vote on whether or not a bill represents a good deed. (positive or negative feedback)
  Allow users to tweet about a bill.
  Republish bill data as a JSON feed with voting results included.

Test plan:
  Attributes: Fast, Simple, Persistent
  Components: Main bill page, individual bill view, voting system, API in, API out
  Capabilities:
    Main bill page: view and paginate bills, show voting results at a glance
    Individual bill: view details about the bill, allow voting via click, 
      show voting results details
    Voting system: Allow voting once per user (TODO!!), allow vote change (?!),
      votes saved in DB, indices on vote table columns allow quick tallying
    API in: grab all bill data from sunshine foundation on a schedule, save it to disk
    API out: allow authenticated users to vote via API PUT and/or POST, provide bill data with 
      vote tallies via API GET.
