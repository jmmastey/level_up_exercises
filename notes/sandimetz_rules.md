# Sandi Metz's Rules
[Baruco 2013: Rules, by Sandi Metz](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=npOGOmkxuio)

## Taboos, rules, norms - why do we obey them?

* Self-interest - personal game
* Identity status - as part of a gorup
* Authority
* Order
* Social sanctions
* Inherent sactions
* Ignonace
* Habit


## 5 Rules of Object Oriented Code
Norms, not laws

* 100 lines of code per class
* 5 lines of code per method
* 4 paramters passed to a method
* 1 instance variable passed from controller to view
*  2 other class names known by controller
  * (1 business and 1 presenter)

You can break any rule, as long as you can convince someone else it's a good idea

These rules 

* Force you to create small objects 
* Bias objects towards POROS - Plain-old ruby objects
* Each object knows a minimal number of other thing -> very **few dependencies**
* Rule ceiling cutoffs - abitrary but are a means to an end -> reduce cost of software
* Objects over procedures
* Messages are seams that give you changability

Following rules

* Rule followers -> more cooperative
* Willingness to follow rules -> willingness to collaborate
