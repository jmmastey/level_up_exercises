There are two classes in this repository.  One class, Dinos, (in the
dino_class.rb file) takes in a dictionary of data for *one* dinosaur
and stores it in a Dinos object.  
Methods in this class for external use are:

initialize(dictionary of dino data for one dino)
print_dino()



The other class is called Dino_filters.  This class has only one
instance variable which is a list of Dinos objects.  This class
contains methods for filtering the list of Dinos objects by some
search criteria.  It always returns a Dino_filters object so that
the output of one of the search methods can be used as the input
for a next search  method (to allow method chaining).  
Methods in this class are:

initialize(list of dino objects)
find_bipeds()
find_carnivores()
find_dinos_specific_period(string_with_period_name)
find_big_dinos(cutoff_weight_in_lbs_as_integer)
find_small_dinos(cutoff_weight_in_lbs_as_integer)
print_list()


There is a function called read_data in read_data.rb.  This function
reads the CSV files and creates both a Dino_filters object (dino_filter_objects)
and a list of Dinos (dino_objects).  

If you want to print the info an a specific dino, you can call
print_dino on a Dinos object (dino_objects).  
Ex.  dino_objects[2].print_dino   (to print the info on dino #3)

If you want to print info on a list of dinos,  you can call print_list
on the Dino_filters object.
Ex. dino_filter_objects.print_list

Examples for filtering are in the main.rb script.
