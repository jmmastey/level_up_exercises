Objective-C port of the twitter-text handling libraries.

This library supports OS X 10.7+ and iOS 4+, both ARC and non-ARC environments.

== Set up Xcode

Make sure Xcode 5+ is already installed. Install the Command Line Tools in Xcode.

  Preferences -> Downloads -> Command Line Tools

Run the following command, so that we can use xcodebuild:

  sudo xcode-select -switch /Applications/Xcode.app/Contents/Developer

== Tests

To run the Conformance test suite, simply run rake:

  rake

Once you ran rake, you can run the tests in Xcode. Open testproject/TwitterText.xcodeproj with Xcode and hit Cmd+U.
